Good Enough Recommendations (GER) is a collaborative filtering based recommendations engine.
GER is built to be easy to use and integrate into any application.

#Quick Start Guide

Install `ger` with `npm`:

```bash
npm install ger
```

require `ger` into your code:

```javascript
var g = require('ger')
var GER = g.GER
```

Create a [knex](http://knexjs.org/) connection to Postgres:

```javascript
var knex = g.knex({client: 'pg', connection: {host: '127.0.0.1', user : 'root', password : 'root', database : 'ger'}})
```

Initialise a Postgres Event Store Mapper (ESM), which is the mapping between GER and the persistence layer:

```javascript
var psql_esm = new g.PsqlESM(knex)
```

Initialize the tables in PostGres:

```
psql_esm.init_tables() //create the tables if they don't exist
```

Then create the GER instance by passing the ESM:

```javascript
var ger = new GER(psql_esm);
```

Now you are ready to use GER.

#Overview
Using a recommendations engine in an application can get greater engagement from its users, and add value that it would otherwise not have been able to. The reason why many applications don't use recommendations engines is that there is significant overhead in implementing a custom engine and many off-the-shelf engines have overcomplicated APIs that do not suite an applications development.

This documentation describes **GER** (Good Enough Recommendations), a recommendation engine that is scalable, easily usable and good enough for your application.

#Good Enough Recommendations (GER)

**All functions from GER return a promise.**

A recommendation engine is a secondary consideration to a product; it is not the highest priority on your list right now, but it is probably on your list. GER's core goal is to let developers easily integrate a recommendation engine that works for their product, but is not overly complex to get up and running. As your product grows and becomes successful, GER can be fine tuned to provide more targeted recommendations. Initially though, **it will just work**.

#GER and its API

GER is a [collaborative filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) engine using the [Jaccard metric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). This means that GER looks at past events of a person, finds similar people, then recommends things that those similar users are doing. Basically, events go into GER and recommendations come out.

## Events
An event is simply a triple: a **person:*String***, an **action:*String*** and a **thing:*String***. For example, **bob** **view** **product_2**. 

```javascript
ger.event("person", "action", "thing");
```


## Recommendations 

To query GER for a list of recommendations you ask what a **person** would like to **action**? For example, to ask GER what would **bob** like to **view**:

```
ger.recommendations_for_person("bob", "view")
```

This will return a list of **thing**s with weights 

## Actions
Each action has a weight (defaulting to 1) which determines how important it is to GER's predictions, e.g. **buying** is more important than **viewing**. The weight of an action can be altered with:

```
ger.action("action", 10)
```
